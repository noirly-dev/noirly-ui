/**
 * Perspective tilt for a card-shaped child.
 *
 * Two elements by design: the outer div owns `perspective`, the inner one owns
 * the rotation and `preserve-3d`. Putting `perspective` on the rotating
 * element itself would make the vanishing point rotate with it, which flattens
 * the effect into a skew.
 *
 * The rect is measured on the *outer* element. The inner card is mid-rotation
 * whenever the pointer is over it, so its own bounding box grows and shrinks
 * with the tilt — measuring that would feed the tilt back into itself and the
 * card would wobble. The outer box never moves.
 *
 * Rotation runs through springs rather than being assigned, which is also what
 * handles the exit: `mouseleave` sets the targets to 0 and the spring carries
 * them home with weight instead of snapping.
 *
 * Reduced motion: the handler returns early, so the card never leaves 0/0, and
 * `@noirly-dev/ui/effects.css` hides the specular.
