/**
 * Accent shutter that wipes the screen on every route change.
 *
 * A note on what the app router can and cannot tell us: `usePathname()` updates
 * *after* the new route has committed. There is no "navigation started" signal
 * available to a layout, so the shutter cannot cover the old page before it
 * leaves. The sequence therefore runs over the new page — wipe on, hold, wipe
 * off — which reads as a deliberate reveal rather than a cover-up, and is the
 * only honest option without intercepting every <Link> in the app.
 *
 * The phase machine is timers over CSS, not a JS animation: the shutter is a
 * single fixed element whose `data-phase` selects a transform and a duration in
 * `@noirly-dev/ui/transitions.css`. The compositor owns the motion; React only
 * names the state it should be in.
